# Instructions for the Lexical Substitution Task
Please note that there is no right or wrong answer. We just want your opinion for each item on this task.

During the course of this experiment, you will be presented with a series of sentences near the top of your screen. Each sentence has one word that is the `test word'. We would like you to find a substitute for the test word that preserves the meaning of the word as it is used in the sentence as much as possible.

## Annotation Examples

|Greer Garson was a world famous **star**. |
|------------------------------------------|
|Substitute: **Actress**                   |

You may also put a substitute that is close in meaning, even though it doesn't preserve the meaning. In such cases, please aim for a word as close as possible to the meaning of the test word, and preferably one more general than the target word. Please ONLY use a more general word if you really can't find a substitute that is a near match for the target word in meaning.

For example:

|The teacher drew **stars** on the board. |
|------------------------------------------|
|Substitute: **Shape**                   |

Sometimes if you really cannot think of a substitute, you may use the non-label '-' response.

## Erroneous or ungrammatical sentences
The sentences included in this task were all gathered from the World Wide Web. They may be very long or short and some may be badly formed in some way. You may find that there are things that make a certain sentence hard to understand. Also, the sentence together with its one sentence of preceding and one sentence of succeeding context need not make a full, self-contained paragraph. Try to ignore these issues; focus only on the meaning of the underlined word in the context in which it occurs. If you find that a sentence is so flawed as to impair your ability to understand what the underlined word means, or that the meaning of the underlined word is ambiguous in the sentence, please be sure to leave a comment to this effect.
