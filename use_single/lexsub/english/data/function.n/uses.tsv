1861	"It was a vision very close to the one described by William S Burroughs at the beginning of his novel The Place ofDead Roads, which is set in the neighbouring states of Colorado and New Mexico: "" The only thing that could unite the planet is a united space program... the earth becomes a space station and war is simply out, irrelevant, flatly insane in a context of research centers, spaceports, and the exhilaration of working with people you like and respect toward an agreed-upon objective, an objective from which all workers will gain. Happiness is a by-product of function . The planetary space station will give all participants an opportunity to function."	570:579	541:580	function.n

1864	Today, there is a need for presidents to re-examine the functions of the presidency in a way that brings focus to the position, a focus that is often lacking.  Functions of the Presidency One way of bringing focus to the presidency is to determine what the functions of the position should be . Based upon a large number of interviews with presidents and trustees, a number of readings related to the college and university presidency, and personal observations, it appears that three major functions fall under the umbrella of the president 's office: 1 ) Managing the institution.	160:170	159:294	function.n

1866	This is an artificial bourgeoisie which is not able to accumulate, but which simply squanders the share of surplus value from local labor which reaches it as well as the foreign subsidies from the States or monopolies which protect it. Because of the obvious incapacity of these bourgeois classes to fulfill the normal economic function of a bourgeoisie , each of them faces a subversion based on the bureaucratic model , more or less adapted to local peculiarities , and eager to seize the heritage of this bourgeoisie . But the very success of a bureaucracy in its fundamental project of industrialization necessarily contains the perpsective of its historical defeat: by accumulating capital it accumulates a proletariat and thus creates its own negation in a country where it did not yet exist.	328:337	236:521	function.n
1867	01021371 Ecology Prerequisite: 01021261/01021352 This course will provide students with basic principles of ecology of plants and animals, relation and interactions of organisms and their environment. The composition , structure , function and distribution of populations and the biology of population communities ( producers , consumers , and decomposers ) , ecosystems , nutrient cycles , energy flow , bio-geographical cycles , human impact on environment will be covered . Students will gain an understanding of the importance of applying ecological principles to the conservation and management of different environments ( i.e. pollution and exploitation issues ).	231:240	201:476	function.n
1868	Their arguments are attractive because they are couched in mathematical or scientific terms and backed by what seems to be scientific competence. However , their arguments are identical in function to the creationists ' arguments : rather than provide positive evidence for their own position , they mainly try to find weaknesses in natural selection . As already noted, however, even if their arguments are successful against natural selection, that would not increase the probability of ID.	189:198	146:352	function.n

Its main function is to act as a bridge between your hi-fi and computer , so that you can stream music from one to the other . But it also acts as a wireless access point, and you can plug a printer into it and locate your printer anywhere in the house.	228:237	219:345	function.n
1870	"The subject of his Ph.D., completed in January 2000 at Warsaw University, was how to gain access to the fundamental entity describing the state of a quantum object, namely the wave function. Where most experiments show only "" shadows "" of the wave function in the form of measurement outcomes , Konrad was able to go one step further , designing and implementing a measurement scheme that is sensitive enough to reveal the complete function . From Warsaw he spent a year as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Rochester, after which he moved to the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford, where, in addition to pursuing a number of theoretical projects, he continues to collaborate with Professor Ian Walmsley and his group."	432:441	191:442	function.n
