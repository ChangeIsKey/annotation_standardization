# Instructions for the graded sense annotation task
Adapted from Diana McCarthy's Guidelines (see references)
## Introduction
You, the annotator, will view a series of sentences (uses) containing a target word. Each sentence comes with one sentence of preceding and one sentence of succeeding context.

You will be presented with several descriptions of meanings that may or may not apply to the target word. Each description usually consist of one or more words that are close in meaning and a short definition. If there are no words close in meaning, you will only see the definition. Your task is to rate, for each of these descriptions, how well they reflect the meaning of the target word in the sentence.

## The five-point judgment scale
The scale that you will be using for your judgements ranges from 1, meaning that the description does not reflect the meaning of the target word at all, to 5, meaning that the description exactly reflects the meaning of the target word. You are free to use a rating more than once if you think two descriptions apply to the same degree, and you do not need to use all of the ratings with any given sentence.

Note that there are no right or wrong answers in this task, so please respond based upon your opinions alone. However, please try to be consistent in your judgments.

## Progressing through the task
For each sentence that you are presented with, please supply ratings about the applicability of each description. Language is often ambiguous. Before reading the meaning descriptions, decide upon the most plausible meaning of the target word in the sentence. With this meaning in mind, determine to what extent each description reflects that meaning. You are free to assign the same rating to different descriptions, or to give them different ratings.

You may leave comments during the annotation task.

## Erroneous or ungrammatical sentences
The sentences included in this task were gathered from various sources, including the World Wide Web. They may be very long or short and some may be badly formed in some way. You may find that there are things that make a certain sentence hard to understand. Try to ignore these issues; focus only on the meaning of the target word in the context in which it occurs. If you find that a sentence is so flawed as to impair your ability to understand what the target word means, or that the meaning of the target word is ambiguous in the sentence, please be sure to leave a comment to this effect.

## Sample Annotation
Let us consider the example text:

| Text                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This veteran , the oldest pensioner in Great Britain , entered the army in 1758 , and was **severely** wounded at the battle of Quebec under General Wolfe , in consequence of which he became an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital , and continued so for the period of seventy-five years .               |


Our target word is **severely**, for which we have 3 senses:

| Word         | Sense                                |  Rating  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| severely     |  "to a severe or serious degree"     | 5        |
| severely     |  "with sternness; in a severe manner"| 1        |
| severely     |  "causing great damage or hardship"  | 4        |

For each sense, the annotator has given a rating for the target word in the example text. The highest rated sense is "to a severe or serious degree", which has been rated **5**. This is because the example sentence describes a the degree to which the soldier was wounded. 

The second sense, "with sterness; in a severe manner", has been rated **1**.

The third sense, "causing great damage or hardship", has been rated **4**. This sense is also closely related to the meaning of the target word in the sample text.

Here, we see an example of an annotation with the verb "to shed":

| Text                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Why such a wierd cat? Two reasons -- first , since Ripley has no hair , she doesn't **shed**.|

The target word has 4 senses.

| Word         | Sense                                                                        |  Rating  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| shed         |  cast off hair, skin, horn, or feathers                                      | 5        |
| shed         |  cause or allow (a solid substance) to flow or run out or over               | 2        |
| shed         |  get rid of                                                                  | 3        |
| shed         |  pour out in drops or small quantities or as if in drops or small quantities | 1        |

The first sense is a perfect match to the use of "shed" in the sentence as the topic is a cat shedding its hair. Therefore, the first sense is rated **5**. THe second sense "to allow to flow or run out or over" is distantly related but far in meaning from the target sentence. Therefore it is rated **2**. Third meaning "get rid of" is relatively close in meaning to the use of "shed" in the target sentence and has been rated **3**. The final sense is the furthest in meaning from the target sentence and has been rated **1**.

Finally, we see an example using the noun, **coach**.
| Text                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This is the biological foundation of social life as a human being. This is also at the very essence or heart of being a **coach**. Coaches do whatever they do in conversations.                            |

The target word has 5 senses.

| Word         | Sense                                                                        |  Rating  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| coach        |  a carriage pulled by four horses with one driver                            | 1        |
| coach        |  a railcar where passengers ride                                             | 1        |
| coach        |  a vehicle carrying many passengers; used for public transport               | 1        |
| coach        |  a person who gives private instruction (as in singing, acting, etc.)        | 5        |
| coach        |  (sports) someone in charge of training an athlete or a team                 | 4        |


In this example, the sense of the word "coach" is relatively unambiguous. The first 3 senses related to menas of transportation are rated **1**. The fourth sense is rated **5** as the topic of the "coach" referened is clearly an instructor of some kind. The final sense is rated **4** as it is not explicitly stated whether the coach is an athletics coach.
