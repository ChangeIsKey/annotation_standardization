# Instructions for the sense selection task

## Introduction
During the course of this experiment, you will be presented with a series of sentences as well as a target word.

You will be provided several descriptions of meanings that may or may not apply to the target word. Your task is to decide which description best reflects the meaning of the target word in the sentence. You can select more than one description provided that they all equally fit the meaning of the target word as it is used in the sentence.

Note that there are no right or wrong answers in this task, so please respond based upon your opinions alone. However, please try to be consistent in your judgments.

## Progressing through the task
For each sentence that you are presented with, please select the most appropriate description (or more than one if they are equally applicable). Language is often ambiguous. Before reading the meaning descriptions, decide upon the most plausible meaning of the target word in the sentence.

## Erroneous or ungrammatical sentences
The sentences included in this task were gathered from various sources, including the World Wide Web. They may be very long or short and some may be badly formed in some way. You may find that there are things that make a certain sentence hard to understand. Try to ignore these issues; focus only on the meaning of the target word in the context in which it occurs. If you find that a sentence is so flawed as to impair your ability to understand what the target word means, or that the meaning of the target word is ambiguous in the sentence, you may select a non-label '-'.

## Sample Annotation
Please see a sample annotation given a sentence containing the target word **coach**. 

| Text                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This is the biological foundation of social life as a human being. This is also at the very essence or heart of being a coach . Coaches do whatever they do in conversations.                                                                                 |

The word **coach** has 5 sense descriptions. As the annotator, you must choose the sense which most closely matches the use of the target word in the sentence.

| Word         | Sense                                                                        |  Judgmnent  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| coach        |  a carriage pulled by four horses with one driver                            | 0           |
| coach        |  a railcar where passengers ride                                             | 0           |
| coach        |  a vehicle carrying many passengers; used for public transport               | 0           |
| coach        |  a person who gives private instruction (as in singing, acting, etc.)        | 1           |
| coach        |  (sports) someone in charge of training an athlete or a team                 | 0           |


In this example, the annotator has selected the 4th sense description as the closest match. The word **coach** in the example text refers to a person who gives some kind of instruction.

In this example, the annotator is making rating sense descriptions for the target word **severely** in a sentence.

| Text                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This veteran , the oldest pensioner in Great Britain , entered the army in 1758 , and was **severely** wounded at the battle of Quebec under General Wolfe , in consequence of which he became an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital , and continued so for the period of seventy-five years .                          |


The target word has 3 senses:

| Word         | Sense                                |  Judgment  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| severely     |  "to a severe or serious degree"     | 1          |
| severely     |  "with sternness; in a severe manner"| 0          |
| severely     |  "causing great damage or hardship"  | 0          |

In this example, the annotator has selected the first sense ('to a severe or serious degree') as the best-fitting sense description for the target word in the sentence. The word 'severely' describes the degree to which the soldier was wounded.

Finally, we see an example with the target word **shed**.

| Text                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Why such a wierd cat? Two reasons -- first , since Ripley has no hair , she doesn't **shed**.|

The target word has 4 senses.

| Word         | Sense                                                                        |  Judgment  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|

| shed         |  cause or allow (a solid substance) to flow or run out or over               | 0          |
| shed         |  get rid of                                                                  | 0          |
| shed         |  pour out in drops or small quantities or as if in drops or small quantities | 0          |

Here, the annotator has selected the first sense description as the best match for the use of the target word in the text. The word **shed** refers to a cat casting off her hair.
